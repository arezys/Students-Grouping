# 📊 K-Means Clustering for Forming Heterogeneous Learning Groups

This project aims to apply the K-Means Clustering algorithm to form heterogeneous student learning groups based on characteristics such as personality (BFI), self-efficacy (GSE), and academic motivation (MSLQ).
This approach is expected to improve learning outcomes through the **Collaborative Learning model**.
