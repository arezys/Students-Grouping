# ðŸ“Š K-Means Clustering for Forming Heterogeneous Learning Groups

This project aims to apply the K-Means Clustering algorithm to form heterogeneous student learning groups based on characteristics such as personality (BFI), self-efficacy (GSE), and academic motivation (MSLQ).
This approach is expected to improve learning outcomes through the **Collaborative Learning model**.

## âœ¨ Features
- Preprocess student data from questionnaire results.
- Use the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to help create heterogeneous groups.
- Visualize clustering results in graphs.
- Save clustering outputs to **Excel** or **CSV**.
